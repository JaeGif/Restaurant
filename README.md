# Restaurant
Project to make a small website advertising a fictional restaurants menu. Practice using ES6 Modules, NPM, and Webpack.

Website is fully generated by JS with styling in a separate CSS file. 

Clicking on tabs allows switch between different page views

This was a great exercise in using modules to reuse code!
